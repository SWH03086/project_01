                    Hi there! My name is Mykhaylyk Danylo The Anh. I'm the leader of the Fantastic Coders group; my two teammates are Nguyen The Hai and Pham Tran Gia Bao. We are making a website with the theme of an I.T. corporation advertising its vacant positions! I do believe that we have done a wonderful job for a group that just learned the basics of HTML & CSS. We hope that you, dear professor, would give us an exceptionally high score for our project. We have put our heart and soul into making this just for you!
